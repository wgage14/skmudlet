This amulet was used in ancient days by a half-elven woman from what is
now the Empire of the Bright Star.  The woman was known as a guardian of the
forest.  The woman was allegedly able to travel between all the major
forests of the east very rapidly, and some say it was attributable to this
amulet.  A sage from Tlaxcala, having studied references to the amulet in
occult literature, determined that one could use the amulet to create a
greenway, to travel between forests.  In order to create a greenway, one
must first initiate it from one destination and then link it from another.

            "Synopsis: How to gain access to the Secret Street in Selhys.
Selhys Quest Chain (Runed Mists Cloak, Bitter Flames Lamp, Pebble Necklace):

1. Ask Abalan for *permission* to enter. (Abalan and Selhys are located a bit east and north of the entrance to the Cloud Realms)

2. Buy a screwdriver from Craeftilian at Kilpailla's Household Goods and Miscellaneous Pawn - a screwdriver of steel (brand new)

3. Go to the cottage southwest of Nerina and ask the old lady about Abalan. She will ask for a screwdriver. Give her screwdriver
you purchased in step #2.

4. Purchase berryweiss and a couple of foggy potions from Verlain.

5. Get the brown book from the Teron library and read it.

6. Return to to Abalan above Selhys. He will give you a mark that allows you to enter without the guards attacking you.

7. Quaff a foggy potion and enter the *shallows*

8. Find the Lorekeeper of Selhys. There will be three conchs near him - red, black, and gold. Read them in that order.

9. Take the berryweiss you purchased in Verlain to the blind guy (whisking) inside Selhys and ask him: \"Is something wrong?\"
Accept his request to get him berryweiss. After you give him the berryweiss, he will give you access to the secret street.

10. Say \"Searothonc\" to open the locked door and enter the secret street. There are three vendors on the street.

11. Go to end of street and type sadko three times. If the items are not already taken, \"lumps\" will form in the ground that you
can dig up with a shovel. There are three items that spawn there: The Lamp of Bitter Flames, The Runed Cloak of the Mists,
and the pebble necklace.


Wiskin drinks beer from a stone mug of berryweiss.
Wiskin exclaims 'Ah!'
Wiskin says 'Here's something that'll help ya, a bit, friend. To get into the Hidden Street, you just say the name. Seventh-of-Sixth.'
Wiskin grins.

The \"seventh-of-sixth\" is Searothonc, which you can find out in character from the conch near the Lorekeeper. by aello on 2018-06-21 08:01:57"

            "Synopsis: Cuz the game is non-newb friendly and this information isn't available in helpfiles.
All characters get these bonuses the year AFTER the math states they'll get the age tick.

Human for example gets the first age tick at 45 years of age. The effects will occur at 46 years of age. The second age tick at 3/4 (90*0.75)=67.5 years of age. The aging will not occur till 68 years. Finally the last one occurs at 82 years of age but won't take effect till 83.

There doesn't seem to be any evidence of the game doing any rounding or anything at all with the floating point numbers. Elves for instance mathematically age at 137.5, 206.25, and 247.5. All aging effects simply take effect at 138, 207, and 248 years of age.

There's really no evidence that a character loses any points in constitution. Even at late stages of my elf merc's life gaining spirit disorientation did not reduce me under Durable constitution.

1st tick: -1 str, -1 dex
2nd tick: -1 str, +1 int, +1 wis, +1 cha
3rd tick: -1 str, -1 dex, +1 int, +1 wis, +1 cha

The losses in str are not as devastating as they may appear to melee characters. With possession of the armor of spartan samtavan I did some testing with melee weapons on my hellion. There was no difference the amount of attacks it took to kill the horrors in Lower Morea. Due to the horrors apparently having no head or arm or hand slots with aim mid I was always consistently hitting the chest area. I did this several times with a rapier and a bastard sword. The bastard sword ranged from 33-37 attacks to kill the horrors (about 11-13 rounds) while the rapier consistently took 90-100 attacks (30-34 rounds). Consecrate weapon was also disappointing as it did not improve the rapier with the damage enchantment to be much at all. Concluded that damage is probably the single most important stat when choosing a weapon to use.

Characters can also only lose a maximum of 2 dexterity points from their racial maximum at venerable age. The second age tick does not produce a reduction.

The buffs to wisdom are meaningless for all classes, except perhaps the barbarian as that's the only way to increase maximum mana for more berserking. Unfortunately stat points cannot be invested into stats that are increased beyond the racial maximum by aging. It's only possible to raise them with stat mods. Caster classes will benefit more from mana trains for increased mana and regen.

The charisma buff is situational based on class. Mercenary, Swashbuckler (lulz), scout and bard would benefit from it.

The increase from intelligence, however, is huge. 2 points is a lot at 21+.

So aging for melee is a mild meh, unless you play a giant in which case the str loss will t-rekt your ability to wield weapons, or multiple pogchamp spam if you're a caster. by aello on 2018-06-21 08:13:42",

(turn statue base), ne, ne, n, nw, ne, n, w, sw, sw(entrance, unlock s, s

Next Area (keep moving dagger to side on Mira statue until you get to another chamber)
- horror that hits HARD spawns, some rooms have no magic so you cant heal, cycle rescue if you need to
- it alternates between Mira Status room and hallway, spawns horror when dagger is moved, when moving to hallway, instantly transfers to mira room

Whole hallway Path: d, se(no magic), ne(no magic), nw, nw(no magic), RUN sw sw(no magic), RUN SE(no magic) SE, Dont touch door to south unless ready and buff up, op s, s, train leadership from Ephialtis

Theory: Can skip two-three rooms at a time if your running (not sure if horrors follow you?)
- d
- se, ne, nw
- nw, sw?
- sw, se, se

General Strategy for Ephialtis:
- refocus on Ephialtis(shadows rescue)
- heal by formation number (DO NOT HEAL YOUR SHADOW(by name))
- Don't have elves of centaurs as your main tank, because finger of death and magma hurts

Dispel ephialtis' spirit aura when ready
- cast interdiction, immune to divine power(hammer of light), magma, weird spell where you fall to the ground (Lord Ephialtis makes a snipping motion with his left hand, you lose control of your limbs for a moment and collapse to the ground.), finger of death, whole room dispirit, blindness, spirit horde, 


Then kill horrors on the way out of the hallway

Go SW once, then say \"A flock of birds in flight.\" Get the key and go NE and through portal. Go all the way north to the closed

3. Go to the cottage southwest of Nerina and ask the old lady about Abalan. She will ask for a screwdriver. Give her screwdriver
you purchased in step #2.

4. Purchase berryweiss and a couple of foggy potions from Verlain.

5. Get the brown book from the Teron library and read it.

6. Return to to Abalan above Selhys. He will give you a mark that allows you to enter without the guards attacking you.

7. Quaff a foggy potion and enter the *shallows*

8. Find the Lorekeeper of Selhys. There will be three conchs near him - red, black, and gold. Read them in that order.

9. Take the berryweiss you purchased in Verlain to the blind guy (whisking) inside Selhys and ask him: \"Is something wrong?\"
Accept his request to get him berryweiss. After you give him the berryweiss, he will give you access to the secret street.

10. Say \"Searothonc\" to open the locked door and enter the secret street. There are three vendors on the street.

11. Go to end of street and type sadko three times. If the items are not already taken, \"lumps\" will form in the ground that you
can dig up with a shovel. There are three items that spawn there: The Lamp of Bitter Flames, The Runed Cloak of the Mists,
and the pebble necklace.


Wiskin drinks beer from a stone mug of berryweiss.
Wiskin exclaims 'Ah!'
Wiskin says 'Here's something that'll help ya, a bit, friend. To get into the Hidden Street, you just say the name. Seventh-of-Sixth.'

The master's abode
  You are in a stone chamber with an undefinable shape and size.  Despite
the obvious solidness of the stone, shadows seem to move and swirl not just
on it, but within it.  Windows periodically open to distant realms,
remaining open for mere moments before closing again.  Unholy etchings that
you cannot read, yet somehow understand, invoke the power of the Void, and
can be seen in disturbing groupings throughout the chamber, some in the
stonework, and some in the air itself.

This pendant was crafted in the Dreamscape and is said to be instilled
with blessings from Mira herself.  Some lore holds that it was crafted by
the Dreamsmith, for a love of his from the material world who he wished to
see often.  It is said that the pendant will aid those who journey to the
Dreamscape against the dangers they face when traveling there.  It is also
purported to have another function, that of Dream Travel, and can be used to
select a destination, and then travel back to it.   One esoteric story holds
that the lover of the Dreamsmith was, in fact, an agent of the Void who
deceived the Dreamsmith into forging the pendant, and that the pendant was
taken by servants of Thuban for some foul purpose that remains unknown by
keepers of lore.

This orb was crafted in ancient times by a halfling priestess of Life. 
It is widely held among lorekeepers that this means she was a priestess of
Nashira, but some argue she was a priestess of Yed, while a small minority
believes she was a priestess of Meissa.  The orb is reputed to contain an
unlimited reservoir of life water, a substance that quenches thirst and has
the ability to mend wounds.  One who holds the orb may attempt to pour water
from it to produce a healing droplet.  The priestess was part of a
resistance movement against a rising group of halfling necromancers on the
island where she lived.  The resistance was eventually crushed, though some
of its members escaped to the Pyrathian mainland.

It is also said that this ring will grant great powers to those who wear it, but that only a gnome can wear it for long. This ring is said to have a sister ring. Both this ring and its sister grant their bearers great powers yet leave the bearer of each vulnerable to the bearer of the other. These rings were lost when the soldiers of Emperor Zhang of Zhenshi ransacked the gnome caverns. The rings were said to be lost somewhere in the Eastern Seas. Both rings were created as a set of three, along with The Fickle Ring of Welcome and Unwelcome Knowing, the legendary Ring of Visions that allowed the denizens of Pyrathia to learn how to vanquish the Leviathan.

A sanctum of grey stone and shadow
  While built with spacious distances between walls, this sanctuary hall
hardly allows enough headroom for a man of large stature to walk comfortably
through it.  The low ceiling hovers overhead, cracked and grown with pieces
of dangling vegetation.  The ankle deep water here keeps the air moist,
adding to the claustrophobic feel of the chamber.  The stone walls are
constructed of large grey stones - each the size of a small horse.  While
they are locked together without any kind of mortar or tar, the seams of the
walls are also grown with swamp weeds.   A small amount of magical energy
seems to be seeping through the doorway of the temple, clashing with the
darkness within.  It seems however, as if the clash is enough to possibly
allow one to recall from this nightmare.

This shield originates from the Dreamscape, where it is often in the
possession of the Dream Dragon therein.  In addition to greatly improving
the wearer's reflexes, it grants special protection and vision capabilities
to the wearer.  Finally, it is said to block attempts at prying into the
wearer's dreams.   

This is the Dream Ward, a tiny dragonscale shield, weighing approximately
2 lbs.  Protection is superior against pointy things, superior against blunt
trauma, and superior against edged weapons.  It is of near god-like
workmanship and should fetch a little less than 500 silver in a respectable
shop.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to increase reflex. by abctest on 2020-12-26 20:21:17"

Bring Me The Head of Qul'xon.
Bring Me The Head Of Rajjin.

I'll start off my area guides on the Island of Owyran. Rajjin wants the head of Qul'xon. And later Qul'xon asks for the head of Rajjin.

These guides are very \"hold-your-hand\" style so that players of nearly all experience levels can accomplish them.
Hope this helps someone out there.
If I get good feedback I'll post more guides in the future. 

If people could post html grabs of each loot pile, I'd appreciate that.
Quest: Bring me Qul'xon's Head or Bring Me Rajjin's Head

You have in your hands what is quite easily one of the most sacred holy
relics within the realms.  The sword Daemon's Bane is said to have been once
part of an ancient demi-god's personal blade.  During the Age of Wonders,
before history even seems to date, it is said that a realms-shaking battle
was fought in what is now called the Wastelands.  The epic struggle between
a holy demi-god and fiendish daemon left the world shaking violently for
decades.  In the end, the god struck the daemon viciously, landing a killing
blow across its face with his sword.  Upon doing so, the daemon fell to the
ground forming the mountainous spine of the wastelands.  Upon falling to the
ground, one of the fiend's teeth fell to the ground along with a shard of
the mighty divine blade.  Legend has it that concentrating on the runeword
ohifl will call forth the demi-gods wrath upon a chosen victim.

- Should lure from the entry point of the base statue
- For shadow, form a mini party and fight your own shadow and heal by formation so you dont heal your shadow

Nightmare Hall Mechanics:
- Everytime you move to a different room you are transferred to the statue room
- Different positions of the statues have different spells - \"side\" dagger is maledictions only and is safest
- Only one person should move the dagger in the statue room
- Horrors spawn only one at a time
- Statue room is where you can cast spells
- Can keep spells when being transferred out of the statue room even if the room is anti-magic
- You lose spells when moving between rooms in the hallway so you can to rebuff everytime in the statue room
- NEVER FLEE - because when party flees in multiple directions it will summon multiple horrors and they hit hard
- Logic of the hallway is the more fear you have, the more lethal the place is
- Horrors randomly spawns items when killed - so you have to keep summoning horrors to get all the loot 

Ephialtes Mechanics
- Ephialtes summons shadows that rescue him so you have to constantly refocus onto him
- Ephialtes casts interdiction, magma, special prone skill where you have to stand up, finger of death, whole room dispirit, blindness, spirit horde
- Heal by formation and not by player name because you will heal your shadow instead
- Dont have elves or centaur as main tank because he fingers and magmas by abctest on 2019-05-28 19:06:49",

- Spellward
- Shield
- Mirror image
- dispel
- heal wounds
- other sorc spells?
- time stop
- Mystical glow right after timestop (so if you dont die by time stop, you die by the spells after)
- To survive, you need to be able to take timestop distributed damage and acid blast and magic missile in one whole blow
- After Somnium uses timestop, he cant use scripts anymore

Theories on Killing Somnium:
Theory 1:
- Have someone that does no damage attack somnium with two people behind him
- Allow timestop to distribute the damage between the three people
- Tell the rest of the party to come in and kill Somnium

Theory 2:
- theres a keyword that breaks you out of his timestop
- maybe has something to do with something in the room with the hourglasses

Theory 3:
- Load one person that has a weapon that they dont know for zero mage
- Buff him up with every single protection spell in the game
- Send him in alone until Somnium uses timestop
- Get everyone to come in and beat up Somnium (assuming he can only use it once per area reset) by abctest on 2019-05-29 03:35:29",

This blade is of an ancient design reminiscent of daemonic workmanship. 
The handle is elongated, and appears to be suitable for the wielder to
shift between a one or two-handed grip.   This famed blade is said to have
once belonged to Ephialtis, before he became Lord Ephialtis.  Upon attaining
his status as the master of the Nightmares Temple he came into possession of
another, more sinister weapon, and allegedly discarded this blade.  Its

Legend has it this strange axe was crafted by a member of Clan Kraleran
in the dwarven city of Vaerlain.  It was created in response to an argument
this clan member had with a group of gnomes in neighboring Craeftilin
regarding appropriate gem mining techniques.  The gnomes berated the
recalcitrant dwarf, calling into question his ability as a miner.  He spent
years mining diamond ores and working up plans for an axe specially designed
to inflict maximum pain on gnomes.  He went searching some distant tunnels
when he finished his axe and got wind of the gnomes' whereabouts.  The
tunnels were remote, and he got lost.  He ran across a wandering deep-elf
and asked for directions, taking time to tell his tale of seeking vengeance.
The deep-elf, intrigued by the story, told him the way, but crept back to
his brethren and formed a party to ambush the dwarf and take the axe, for
the deep-elves were plotting an assault on Craeftilin and wanted the weapon
for themselves in their upcoming war against the gnomes.

Flawless in design, this exquisite weapon appears to be the work of both
natural and magical craftsmanship.  The main material is diamond, but fused
into the gemstone appears to be several types of ores, ranging from the
oxides found in the Lost Jungle, to several types of ores sold in
Craeftilin.  The desert lily motif is decidedly Zhensh the lily
traditionally representing the unexpected verdancy often found at the
borders of desolation.  The style appears similar to that found with the
Grahme smithy, which may suggest that this is the legendary weapon
commissioned in the beginning of the 900s, by a customer known only to the
few.  A group of adventurers was sent questing for his needs, among them the
Chieftain of Ayamao and the Defender of the Verdant Arcane, and they defied
great danger to aid him.  It is said that the sword contains a magical pulse
which is activated upon a thorough polishing, which enables the sword to
mend itself from within.  It is also said that It is possible to store life
force within the blade, calling it forth in times of need, upon command. 
The name to be used to bring forth the life force is 'Aailjiyah', supposedly
the name of the customer's one and only love.  The name to be used to draw
it is 'Zehera', which cruel tongues claim is the name of the customer's
wife.

Legend has it that this pike belonged to a great winged daemon of
misfortune and slaughter.  The daemon was unable to retrieve the weapon from
the intense heat of the volcano, and so it was left there for ages.  As it
lay there it absorbed the power of the volcano into itself and began to
mimic the qualities of a volcano.  Red hot fire runs up the majority of the
shaft of the pike, and it is hot enough to rival even hot magma.  The thick
smoke that flows from it is said to be able to wrap about the wearer and
make him invisible by concentrating on the syllables uizug.

Some griffon prides in Owyran would hold a ceremony for the dead.  This
ritual was to honor the deceased.  Sky jousts were held and feasts were
served all in honoring the memories of the deceased.  Upon ending this
ritual they would drop the honored corpse into a great volcano in hopes that
the soul may return in the form of a phoenix.

The markings are of ancient griffon times.  They speak of the honor one
would have of becoming a great phoenix, as well as the infinite knowledge
they believed the phoenix to hold.  Engraved at the very end of the markings
the word 'recipero' can be made out.

in and allowing him to observe the rituals and secluded life of the griffon

Legends speak of a pair of brothers, a powerful warrior and a clever
sorcerer, in the ranks of the Hammer of Light, long ago.  The warrior was
the strongest of the Hammer's riders, but was not known for his
scholarliness or mental capacity.  He was constantly being beaten in battle,
when he failed to make effective use of the spells of the Hammer of Light. 
His brother, concerned with his defeats, crafted this amulet for him and, in
doing so, imparted some of his own mental capacity into it.  The amulet is
said to refresh the energy of a rider of the light when the strains of
invincibility are heavy on his mind.

[Spells help] true seeing

Syntax: cast 'true seeing' 

True seeing is the ultimate divination spell, combining all of the various 
detect spells into one, including detect aura. It also allows the recipient 
to see in both normal and magical darkness, see through normal and magical
disguises, mirror images and other spatial distortions. 

True seeing can only be cast by priests of Dulrik, either on themselves or
the god of truth's followers. Rare potions of this spell are highly valued.

See also: detect 'detect aura' 'know alignment' dulrik

[Spells help] symbol of pain

Syntax: cast 'symbol of pain' 

The symbol of pain spell blasts the nerves of the victim with pain, making it
difficult for synapses to fire quickly. This manifests as a slow down in both
weapon attack speed and casting time. The victim receives a fortitude save to
reduce the effect in half. Even after a successful save, the symbol can be 
improved by a second casting. The spell can only be cast on creatures capable
of feeling pain. Symbol of pain can only be cast by priests of Sadr.

See also: fortitude sadr

[Spells help] feast of fear

Syntax: cast 'feast of fear' 

Feast of fear is a spell as complex and to be as savored as a fine wine. It 
is primarily a buff spell but obtains its power by stealing from the caster's 
opponents.  The victim is shaken, which causes a decrease in all stats. The 
victim gets a willpower save to halve the effect and negate the vampirism.

On the first successful feeding, the caster's stats (including their peak 
stats) will be improved.  Although the caster may feast on each victim only 
once, there is no end to the number of different meals.  For the next several 
targets, the caster's stats will continue to increase (although not their peak 
stats). Thereafter feasts serve only to continue the duration of the spell.

Feast of fear can only be cast by priests of Algorab.

See also: stats willpower algorab

[Spells help] dispirit

Syntax: cast 'dispirit' 

The dispirit spell decreases the connection between the body and the spirit.  
The victim is allowed no saving throw and acquires a penalty to all stats.  
This penalty can be doubled by up to two additional castings against the 
same target. Dispirit can only be cast by priests of Achernar.

See also: stats 'saving throw' achernar

[Spells help] devotion

Syntax: cast 'devotion'                                    

The devotion spell links the casting priest with another individual. A 
portion of the damage taken by the recipient will instead be taken by the 
caster instead. Devotion can only be cast by priests of Aludra.

See also: aludra

[Spells help] accelerate healing

Syntax: cast 'accelerate healing'                                    

The accelerate healing spell requires that the target have a metabolism, 
but bypasses magic resistance.  The recipient begins regenerating health and
stamina every few moments.  The strength of the regeneration increases as
the recipient moves closer toward death.

Accelerate healing also increases the power of other restorative abilities 
such as cures, healing rays, refresh and songs of healing. Hemorrhage is 
the direct counter of accelerate healing (and vice versa). Accelerate 
healing can only be cast by priests of Meissa.

See also: cure 'healing rays' refresh 'songs of healing' hemorrhage meissa

[Spells help] phoenix heart

Syntax: cast 'phoenix heart'                                    

The phoenix heart spell provides a competence bonus to weapon accuracy. 
It also allows the recipient to avoid certain death.  If the recipient would 
take a fatal blow, an aura of the phoenix will surround them.  The aura will 
heal them and may also blind the recipient's attackers.  After this the spell 
is expended and must be cast anew.  Phoenix heart can only be cast by priests 
of Alshain, either on themselves or the god of courage's followers.

See also: heal blindness alshain

[Spells help] distort alignment

Syntax: cast 'distort alignment'  

The distort alignment spell masks the recipient's real alignment. Spells 
such as detect aura and know alignment will show the new alignment instead 
of the real one.  It will also fool other types of divinations, such as 
whether a good-aligned item would zap an evil user. Because the spell can
be cast on anyone, it has some strategic uses.

Note that the spell does not change the personality of the recipient, it only 
hides the truth.  Distort alignment can only be cast by priests of Thuban.

See also: alignment 'detect aura' 'know alignment' thuban

[Spells help] confusion

Syntax: cast 'confusion' 

The confusion spell brings chaos to the mind of the victim, who will
attack nearby targets, flee or wander into neighboring rooms at random.
This is a compulsion effect and the victim receives a willpower save to 
avoid the effect.  Confusion can only be cast by priests of Marfik.

See also: flee 'remove compulsion' willpower marfik

[Spells help] energizer

Syntax: cast 'energizer'                                    

The energizer spell replenishes the recipient's mana pool by a variable amount
influenced by the power of the caster.  Using the spell requires the caster
to expend both mana and stamina.  For this reason, it is more effective when
cast on allies than on oneself. Energizer can only be cast by priests of Mira.

See also: mira

[Spells help] luck

Syntax: cast 'luck'                                    

The luck spell provides a luck bonus to weapon accuracy and to dodge. Master
status priests can also slightly increase the recipient's fortitude, willpower
and reflex.  Luck can only be cast by priests of Sadal.

See also: dodge fort will ref sadal


[Spells help] elemental wall

Syntax: cast 'elemental wall'   

Elemental wall allows the caster to create a barrier out of one of the
four elements: fire, earth, air or water.  Each wall has unique abilities.

wall of air - The hurricane winds of a wall of air extend upward to infinity.
It is impossible to traverse while flying and can even stymie ground movement.
Ranged attacks bounce off but most spells can pass through it. A wall of air
is transparent.  It cannot exist underwater and can be dispelled.

wall of earth - A wall of earth is an opaque barrier through which no ranged
attacks or spells may pass.  It will completely seal a passage but when cast
outdoors it may be climbed or flown over.  A wall of earth must be supported
by the ground.  It cannot be dispelled but is vulnerable to dig or earthquake.

wall of fire - The flames of wall of fire extend upward to infinity.  One side
is cool but the other is burning hot.  A wall of fire is opaque but does not
obstruct movement or ranged attacks. However it causes fire damage and may melt
worn equipment. A wall of fire cannot co-exist with water and can be dispelled.

wall of water - A wall of water is an opaque barrier through which no ranged
attacks may pass (although some area effect spells are possible).  It will
seal a passage but may be swam through and flown over when cast outdoors. It
can be dispelled, needs a supporting surface and does not co-exist with lava.

Elementals may pass freely through their own element.  Elemental wall can
only be cast by priests of Yed.

See also: 'dispel magic' dig earthquake yed

[Spells help] warpath

Syntax: cast 'warpath'                                    

The warpath spell provides a competence bonus to weapon damage. It also 
allows the recipient to ignore the compulsive effect from sanctuary and 
intimidate.  Warpath can only be cast by priests of Sargas, either on 
themselves or the war god's followers.

See also: sanctuary intimidate sargas

[Spells help] vitality

Syntax: cast 'vitality'                                    

The vitality spell provides an enhancement bonus to constitution, fortitude
and combat endurance.  It also increases the maximum value of constitution.
Vitality can only be cast by priests of Nashira.

See also: con fort nashira

[Spells help] interdiction

Syntax: cast 'interdiction' 

The interdiction spell paralyzes the victim. While paralyzed, the victim can't
walk, fight, flee or perform any action which requires physical movement. The
spell requires that the target be humanoid, but allows no initial saving
throw. Instead, the victim receives a willpower save every combat round to
temporarily resist the affect and regain control. However, successful saves
cause impairment. Interdiction can only be cast by priests of Ain.

See also: willpower impairment ain

[Spells help] insight

Syntax: cast 'insight'                                    

The insight spell provides an enhancement bonus to intelligence and to
wisdom.  It also increases the maximum value of those two statistics. Insight
also directly counters the feeblemind spell (and vice versa). Insight can only 
be cast by priests of Zavijah and only on light aura recipients.

Syntax: cast 'hemorrhage'                                    

The hemorrhage spell requires that the target be capable of bleeding
and have already taken a wound, but allows no saving throw.  The victim
begins bleeding at an ever increasing rate until the spell fades or until
death. Accelerate healing is the direct counter of hemorrhage (and vice
versa). Other healing spells are reduced in effectiveness but do serve to
reduce the duration. Hemorrhage can only be cast by priests of Dabi.

Stories of the deadly nature of sessprian ghouls and their vicious iron
sickles prompted one group of explorers to commission staves such as this to
give them a better chance of survival against these creatures when trying to
break into the Necropolis through the north gate.  The runes inscribed on it
invoke magnesis magic, which has magnetized the staff and can create a ward
against iron weaponry.  One interesting feature of this ward is that,
because the user's very body is magnetized to deflect iron, the ward
persists even if the staff is removed.

In ancient days, one of the greatest servants of the Goddess of Suffering
was said to be the witch Yonu, who through her magic left this plane
entirely to live in the realm of her Lady, in a hut built from the bones of
Her enemies.  As the story goes, Yonu cultivated the icy thorns on the
Plains of Being Skinned Alive into a garden, which grew over the years into
a tangled maze around her hut, a maze so perplexing even she could never
again leave.  In certain versions of the tale, the thorns finally took root
in Yonu's flesh, entwining her essence with theirs for eternity.  If such
tales are to be believed, the thorny vines now wind through the fabric of
space toward Yonu's former home, seeking the blood of mortals to sustain
their mistress, whose body still hangs frozen in their painful embrace.

  pppyyy  to the renowned portal stones, of which several scatter the
  ppf*-y  realms.  Brave souls have been known to utilize the arcane power
  yfffyy  that is bound to the stones, travelling to far lands in the blink
           of an eye.  At almost opposite sides of the clearing, two roads
meander away.  To the north a gleaming white watchtower rises out of the
vast grassland that surrounds it.   It's partly cloudy, cool, and very

the undergrowth, causing several leaves to flutter about in the wind as if
caught up in a carefree dance.  A river can be glimpsed through the trees
east of here, babbling merrily as it tumbles along.   It's mostly clear,

This etching depicts a deep-elf wearing slim robes and a hood hovering
above a sea of tentacles and toothy maws writhing in a viscous fluid.  The
tentacles are rending people that are trapped in the hideous mass.  You see
partially-torn corpses, bodyparts, and heads with horrified faces being
clutched by the tentacles and devoured by the maws.  Several tentacles reach
just below the deep- elf's feet, but he remains hovering above them with his
arms outstretched, palms up.  Above his left hand floats a shimmering cone,
and upon a finger on his right hand is a ring surrounded by an aura of
darkness. by abctest on 2020-12-05 21:12:46",

This item is one of The Profane Relics of The Fytrysks.  This strange
cone is said to contain Void energies locked within it that allow it to warp
space and time, to move creatures between worlds.  The cone has an
association with the Fytrysks, and was allegedly created to pacify Fytrysks
summoned by a certain ring.  It is said that a Fytrysk summoned in this
manner will sometimes assist the summoner in battle, but other tales say
that more than one summoner has been devoured by a summoned Fytrysk, that
they are unpredictable and uncontrollable.  Most consider use of this device
an entirely foolish act.

Old stories speak of an ancient dragon called Pyraadhus, who once watched
over the land from his home in the sacred forest of Lynthwood.  In time,
humans came to Lynthwood, seeking to build a great city there; Pyraadhus
opposed their work, devouring scores of men.  After many moons passed
stained by their blood, these settlers appealed to their liege, the Emperor
Kol of Aghelus.  It is said that Kol rode to battle Pyraadhus himself, with
seventeen fine hunters beside him.  They surrounded the dragon like a pack
of wolves, and though his peers fell to a man in the conflict, which shook
the bones of the earth itself, Lord Kol prevailed.  To commemorate this
great victory, he sent for his finest craftsmen and his wisest sorcerors,
who cut numberless bladed discs from the great beast's spine, and imprisoned
its soul within, that it might pay for its defiance eternally in defense of
the Empire it had stood against.

It is said that the mighty Dragonslayer, Dyasha, cleaved Antolos in half with one mighty blow, and when she did, the mantle was torn apart.  Soon after, the minotaur people were scattered. Those humbled minotaur who were forced into service under Dyasha's iron fist kept the pieces of the mantle.  When the rebellion came, the restored mantle was donned by the great General Alstor the Avenger.  The great blessings bestowed by the most ancient minotaur ancestors are claimed to have been channeled through this sacred mantle to help achieve victory against the giantess.  Although a great many minotaur spirits were called upon to bless this garment, the highly decorative stitchings suggest a special affinity for the Ancient Minotaur Patron Saint of Protection, the spirit called 'Ayuton'. ayuton still answers the call even today by abctest on 2021-01-05 23:24:02",

This relic was once a powerful artifact of the forces of Light.  It was
corrupted during the siege of what is now known as the Necropolis.  It is
said that the white knight, Lord Varloch placed the amulet around the claws
of the Elder Champion of Xandrennus, just before his mind was taken by the
darkness and he became one of its most vicious minions.  The heart screeched
and wept blood, mourning for its old master, for his oath to never harm
innocent souls, had been broken and the heart, inhabited by the spirit of an
angel, knew this.  The Elder dragon swore to guard the relic, until the time
came for a new, worthy emissary of the Light to bear it.  Even now,
centuries after its guardian's transformation into the dracolich, the heart
awaits.  Although its legendary power has faded, it is said to pulse once in
a while with the glory of former days, bathing the skeletal dragon in its
warm light.

This item is one of The Spiritualist's Sacred Vestments.  Created during
the Blood Wars by the Sorcerer Damacon, the blade was, for a time, an
artifact of the Blood God.  It was, however, lost at the end of the Blood
Wars, like many other things created during that time period.  Many years
later it was rediscovered in some remote cave by the paladin Altanon, a
servant of the White Flame.  The paladin attempted to purify the axe,
converting its power into Alshain's service.  However, something went wrong.
The blade, instead of turning to the Lord Alshain, was instead purged of all
association to the Gods and was infused with ancestral spirits.  Since that
day, it is said that no servant of a god could wield the weapon for long. by abctest on 2020-10-01 17:36:26"

These boots are of ancient elven design, specifically a group of elves
from ancient Uxmal.  Legends speak of a copse of oak trees thousands of
years old that grew where there is now a crater, wherein fallen branches
were periodically gathered and used by the local elves to make weapons and
armor.   

This is some vine-wrapped boots, a medium sacred oak armor, weighing
approximately 5 lbs.  Protection is superior against pointy things, superior
against blunt trauma, and superior against edged weapons.  It is of superior

Haste gives +4 dexterity +4 dexterity peak.  
Haste also gives +4 weapon speed. 

Haste stacks with lightning fist
Haste stacks with fury
Haste stacks with specialization

Haste stacks with innate weapon speed
Haste weapon speed does not stack with weapon speed enchants
Haste takes precedence over enchant speed runes, so it can slow down a weapon with 5 speed runes enchants

Haste slows down mana regeneration

+4 Dexterity can unlock a person's extra hit surpassing race restrictions
Dexterity seems to affect the cap of the number of hits you can achieve
weapon speed/weapon type affects a character's ability to hit maximum hits (so does fury)
specialize can help surpass race restrictions?  specialize is like adding dexterity peak?


Weapon type, size, dexterity, specialize, and race determines the number of max hit.  weapon speed, fury, specialize determines if a character can actually hit the max.

Dwarves are super are exception because they get bonuses to axe.  Their bonus to axe is very similiar to specialize. by abctest on 2020-07-12 16:24:06",

This very sextant was crafted by the Gods of the Seas, and given to the
dreaded pirate, known only after this very item.  It is said that this
sextant is gifted with perfect direction towards isles and ships.  Though,
only one mortal has ever been known to find its secrets, so its lore is
quite clouded and mysterious.  It is said the day that the dreaded
Leviathan attacked the city of Seaside, the pirate ripped his own eye out as
he laid eye on the beast, and jammed it in the center of this sextant, to
live on forever as legend.  It is also said that if one looks closely into
the eye, you can see the legendary beast preparing to destroy the city with
its mighty strength.

This sextant rests here, in perfect condition, encased in a form of
energy, blocking out anything from being able to touch it.  This sextant is

The origins of this armor are unknown, but it is apparent to the
experienced lorekeeper that the material is otherworldly.  Some assume that
it was crafted from the essence of Somnium's captured dreams, but that it
never served its intended purpose.  Before it could be put to use, something
or someone, undid the runes of power woven into it.  But the runes, being
living entities of magic themselves, did not cease to exist.  They were
scattered across the Dreamscape and wait to this day to be retrieved and
united.  If spoken in the correct order, they will summon the power of the

The Social Center of Sith'a'niel
  This chamber is within a fine depression of Sith'a'niel.  Nestled within
this shallow crevice is a gathering place, an elegant social center of the
city.  It follows the southern edge of the tree, the rich and earthy bark
curling inward to cover the depression.  Sap seems to have bled through the
flesh of the bark as it curls inward, a hardened and glossy surface that
smooths over the pocks and weathered crevices of the ancient entity to
create a regal walkway.  An intimidating height above, the crevice curls
outward again to the normal width of the tree.  All along the inner wall and
the arching ceiling, vines and flower buds birth and bloom, the otherwise
dark and rich chamber given a light and vibrant flare of warmth and life. 
  The southern ledge of this crevice is partitioned from the sky by a tall,
fragile wall of elegant alabaster-toned vines spawning vibrant azaleas. 
Along the ledge rests a series of inviting shops.   
  Obvious exits: e s w nw ne

This item is one of Dabi's Sacred Vestments.  Rumors about this
necklace's origin fall to the birth of Dabi herself.  In the time when the
followers of Zynor attempted to unleash him from his eternal slumber, it is
said that Dabi used the Blade of Destruction to slay her father and consume
his being in a bath of blood.  In the ensuing slaughter Zynor was sliced
open, his blood spilled across the land, Dabi found herself a single wound
that released just a few drops of her blood.  An ancient lich from the
fallen city was rumored to have sent minions across the land to collect the
few precious drops of both deities' blood.  It is said the power of the
blood was enough to consume nearly half a legion of undead as they attempted
to contain it's power and return it to its master.  It is never said how the
power was contained, but it is said the blood was given unto the lich for
his purpose.  The second part of the legend is that the lich sent his
minions out once more to collect a thousand mortals.  His minions brought
one thousand beings, each one bound and locked deep within the cursed city. 
The lich then was said to use his ancient magic to sacrifice the scores of
mortals and use their souls to form a vessel for the god's blood.  When the
thousand souls had been forged, the blood was poured into the container and
sealed for all eternity.  The necklace proved too powerful even for the
ancient lich, and he soon found his twisted mind broken under the power of
the god's blood.  The lich's minions saw their master's blight and stole the
necklace away one dark night.  The rumors say it was lost for years before
it resurfaced.  

This is a circle of flowing blood, a medium energy treasure, weighing

reigned there before the Witch-Men of Kol deposed him.  And these have more

This nearly ethereal stave is none other than the legendary Staff of the
Four Winds.   Bound inside is the very essence of Air, in what is rumored to
have been the work of four of the greatest warlocks ever to have lived. 
They bent a portion of the four winds into this vessel, one hardly more
material than the winds themselves.   As each wind differs from the other,
so each wind offers its own blessing.   The first rune is pulietra.   The
second, though difficult to read, is trechalk.   The third, Nesara.   The
fourth, however, appears more fluidly, shifting too much to make out for
certain.   However, you know the old stories well, and recall that the
fourth rune is Enrim.   

This is The Staff of the Four Winds, a medium flame weapon, weighing
approximately 3 lbs.  The weapon is a two-handed bo staff.  It is of
superior workmanship and should fetch a little less than 300 silver in a
respectable shop. by abctest on 2020-09-29 03:17:42",

Lord of Time.  The challenge and trial issued had a heavy price but the
group succeeded in fulfilling the demands, earning the staff.  It was during
a ritual that the power of the staff was transfered to another artifact and
with it the ability to traverse through time itself.  Still, there are
remnants of the Timestaff's power that one may call upon, even if the

Songs of antimagic
- lower magic level
- (D) lower concentration
When to use:  Used in conjunction with taunt/feeblemind/frenzy to stop a caster from casting
- lowering magic level seems to be useless because of the way saves work

- Starts dispeling every round after that and aggros everyone not in party

Countersongs
- neutralize effects of songs

When to use:  Best all-rounded song for PK/PVE.  Weakens melee.  Slows cast.  Puts people not in combat to sleep.
- takes 3-4 rounds to take affect

Conclusion:
- Bards are good for two things, power leveling casters and enhanced consecrate.
- They lack solo ability and they are lacking in support in small groups
- Persuade is worthless and should be downgraded to a journeyman skill, not a top tier skill learned last
- Has the downside of both a warrior(tank/atk) and downside of a mage(mobility). by abctest on 2020-10-06 03:09:44",
            "Are you sure songs of protection doesn't stack with armor and shield because I recall most songs being competence bonuses and shield/armor are deflection bonuses. These should stack.

Persuade is also pretty good since you can use it to hose a Wudan caster that focuses on 100 MR. Doesn't count as a willpower save so you should have your way with such a player. Not sure if you can persuade them to cast final strike, tho. Would be great if you could to remove that character from the game.

Also, not sure if songs of death is even worth it to level with. Bard was by far one of the fastest classes I've ever leveled where I made it to level 25 in 2 hours. That's just from spamming c major/f minor. by ardith on 2020-10-12 18:44:31"

This shield was carried by an Taslamaran griffon in ancient times, who
served the Hammer of Light, and rode with the monks of the White Swan.  The
griffon is said to have had a heart as pure as any mortal creature that ever
lived, so much so that his good deeds attracted attention from the divine
stewards of the light.  A griffon of pure heart can invoke the magic left in
this shield with the command illumus.   

This is a shield of brilliant light, a large energy shield, weighing
approximately 4 lbs.  Protection is superior against pointy things, superior
against blunt trauma, and superior against edged weapons.  It is of near
god-like workmanship and should fetch a little less than 500 silver in a
respectable shop.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to
increase fortitude.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to

and charred chunks of wood.  Plumes of ashes spill into the air with the
passing wind, causing the scent of burning to dominate the area.  The
floating white and grey flakes swirl and cling anything they come in contact
with, caressing everything with their soft touch.  Tufts of fur and crumpled
leaves dance among the chaos.  In the distance more war-torn hills can be

their natural resistance to magic.  For the elite among the deep-elves, who
were able to bolster their magical protection to high levels, the toxic and

Adamantite might be better because it doesn't wear down
Good as a backup skin because skins dont count towards the rule of six and doesn't get wiped during monthly item cleanup

The Imperial general Spartan Samtavan was given a suit of armor as a gift
from all the dark gods upon recognition of his deeds for both his god and
his emperor.  The armor was rumored to be able to make its wearer invisible
at will.  It also increased his strength to almost inhuman proportions.  The
armor was black as the night sky and adorned with the Samtavan family crest.
I remember seeing Spartan wearing this armor when I was just a young man,
visiting my uncle, the infamous Shadow Sorceror in the empire.  I do not
think I shall ever forget the imposing site of Spartan, ready for battle. 
It is rumored that one fit to wear the armor can concentrate on being
'unseen' and will be rendered invisible to normal vision.  In addition,
concentrating on 'empower'ing ones self, will grant the wearer an unusual
surge of strength.

This unique bracelet was once carried by a halfling scout who served a
group of necromancers.  The scout was one of their most elite soldiers, who
spent considerable time tracking down his masters' enemies in their
homeland.  He was routinely seen in the company of a deadly panther.  Some
lorekeepers believe the panther was actually a gift from an otherworldly
being with whom the scout made a pact, and that its spirit lived in this
bracelet.  It is said the panther can be released with the command,
umbralis.

This beautiful golden thimble is engraved with the tiniest runes of
blessing along its outer rim.  Dwarven runes of ancient origin, they are

commitment to ones craft.  The blessing is roughly translated: \"if my heart
be not true, my needle be not true\"

The original owner of this piece of armor was long obsessed with the
destruction of Selkwood.  A deep-elven hellion named M'kantal wore it and
after many years he left his cave in the Ayamaoan mountains in search of a
corrupt and powerful source of destruction in the depths of the Jade City. 
He disappeared into the depths of the caves of N'kyasha and was rumored to
have been seeking the sleeping power of the demon Az'pook.

Crafted in the heart of Ch'zzrym, the Scourge of Vipers is one of the few
remaining artifacts of deep-elven magic.  Ensnared through unholy forces
from the sixth layer of the Abyss itself, these snake-daemons will only obey
the commands of the most favored females of the Dark Blood.  Reflecting the
matriarchical society, the vipers are said to have a hierarchy themselves.

Loth'ganar,Neregth, Jhaniv and K'risham, they would - assuming one is found
worthy - heed the call of their Mistress.  Ssirpril the elderly is the voice
of this whip and she will express your thoughts.   Querv the vile will bite
your foes unleashing her venom on your hapless victims.   Loth'ganar the
strong will mirror your most intense emotions.   Neregth, with her potent
poison will preserve a body for your rituals.   Jhaniv's bite will negate

could find to defend themselves against the Imperial Legions.  Fortunately

  The strong scent of sulphur hangs over this bubbling pit of molten rock. The
searing heat is only made worse by the unusual amount of steam in the room,
the precise source of which is not immediately apparent. The boiling stream of
magma seems to come from somewhere southbound, seemingly then reaching this
single point, probably leading to somewhere farther underground, away from the
surface and into some other, deeper cavern.
