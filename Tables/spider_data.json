            "This item is one of The Gnomish Portal Rings. This ring was once held by the gnomish prophet Zejerian, and in later years, by the gnome prophet Cicatrix, although neither used it. It is also said that this ring will grant great powers to those who wear it, but that only a gnome can wear it for long. This ring is said to have a sister ring. Both this ring and its sister grant their bearers great powers yet leave the bearer of each vulnerable to the bearer of the other. These rings were lost when the soldiers of Emperor Zhang of Zhenshi ransacked the gnome caverns. The rings were said to be lost somewhere in the Eastern Seas. Both rings were created as a set of three, along with The Fickle Ring of Welcome and Unwelcome Knowing, the legendary Ring of Visions that allowed the denizens of Pyrathia to learn how to vanquish the Leviathan. The ring you hold, and its sister rings, were all created by the Chrome Dragon of gnome lore. This is the Temperamental Ring of Warped Wishes, a small platinum exit, weighing approximately 2 lbs.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to increase magical energy. by abctest on 2020-06-06 15:45:28",

The gnomes berated the\nrecalcitrant dwarf, calling into question his ability as a miner.  He spent\nyears mining diamond ores and working up plans for an axe specially designed\nto inflict maximum pain on gnomes.  He went searching some distant tunnels\nwhen he finished his axe and got wind of the gnomes' whereabouts.  The\ntunnels were remote, and he got lost.  He ran across a wandering deep-elf\nand asked for directions, taking time to tell his tale of seeking vengeance.\nThe deep-elf, intrigued by the story, told him the way, but crept back to\nhis brethren and formed a party to ambush the dwarf and take the axe, for\nthe deep-elves were plotting an assault on Craeftilin and wanted the weapon\nfor themselves in their upcoming war against the gnomes.   \n\nThis is Gnomecrusher, a small diamond weapon, weighing approximately 9\nlbs.

Sky jousts were held and feasts were\nserved all in honoring the memories of the deceased.  Upon ending this\nritual they would drop the honored corpse into a great volcano in hopes that\nthe soul may return in the form of a phoenix.\n\nThe markings are of ancient griffon times.  They speak of the honor one\nwould have of becoming a great phoenix, as well as the infinite knowledge\nthey believed the phoenix to hold.  Engraved at the very end of the markings\nthe word 'recipero' can be made out.  \n\nThis is the Phoenix Crest, a large adamantite shield, weighing\napproximately 10 lbs.

            "lore ferro\nStories of the deadly nature of sessprian ghouls and their vicious iron\nsickles prompted one group of explorers to commission staves such as this to\ngive them a better chance of survival against these creatures when trying to\nbreak into the Necropolis through the north gate.  The runes inscribed on it\ninvoke magnesis magic, which has magnetized the staff and can create a ward\nagainst iron weaponry.  One interesting feature of this ward is that,\nbecause the user's very body is magnetized to deflect iron, the ward\npersists even if the staff is removed.   \n\nThis is a ferromagnetic bo staff, a small cold iron weapon, weighing\napproximately 3 lbs.  The weapon is a two-handed bo staff.  It is of above\naverage workmanship and should fetch a little less than 250 silver in a\nrespectable shop.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to\nincrease weapon speed.  Items like this often bear an innate enchantment to\nincrease weapon damage.

            "lore wreath\nIn ancient days, one of the greatest servants of the Goddess of Suffering\nwas said to be the witch Yonu, who through her magic left this plane\nentirely to live in the realm of her Lady, in a hut built from the bones of\nHer enemies.  As the story goes, Yonu cultivated the icy thorns on the\nPlains of Being Skinned Alive into a garden, which grew over the years into\na tangled maze around her hut, a maze so perplexing even she could never\nagain leave.  In certain versions of the tale, the thorns finally took root\nin Yonu's flesh, entwining her essence with theirs for eternity.  If such\ntales are to be believed, the thorny vines now wind through the fabric of\nspace toward Yonu's former home, seeking the blood of mortals to sustain\ntheir mistress, whose body still hangs frozen in their painful embrace.  \n\nThis is a wreath of ice-thorns, a medium water armor, weighing\napproximately 5 lbs.  Protection is average against pointy things, average\nagainst blunt trauma, and average against edged weapons.  It is of\noutstanding workmanship and should fetch a little less than 200 silver in a\nrespectable shop.

            "According to legend, the Mantle of the Minotaur Kings was the mantle of authority worn by the great King Antolos of the Minotaur.  It is said that the mighty Dragonslayer, Dyasha, cleaved Antolos in half with one mighty blow, and when she did, the mantle was torn apart.  Soon after, the minotaur people were scattered. Those humbled minotaur who were forced into service under Dyasha's iron fist kept the pieces of the mantle.  When the rebellion came, the restored mantle was donned by the great General Alstor the Avenger.  The great blessings bestowed by the most ancient minotaur ancestors are claimed to have been channeled through this sacred mantle to help achieve victory against the giantess.  Although a great many minotaur spirits were called upon to bless this garment, the highly decorative stitchings suggest a special affinity for the Ancient Minotaur Patron Saint of Protection, the spirit called 'Ayuton'. ayuton still answers the call even today by abctest on 2021-01-05 23:24:02",

It is\nsaid that the white knight, Lord Varloch placed the amulet around the claws\nof the Elder Champion of Xandrennus, just before his mind was taken by the\ndarkness and he became one of its most vicious minions.  The heart screeched\nand wept blood, mourning for its old master, for his oath to never harm\ninnocent souls, had been broken and the heart, inhabited by the spirit of an\nangel, knew this.  The Elder dragon swore to guard the relic, until the time\ncame for a new, worthy emissary of the Light to bear it.  Even now,\ncenturies after its guardian's transformation into the dracolich, the heart\nawaits.  Although its legendary power has faded, it is said to pulse once in\na while with the glory of former days, bathing the skeletal dragon in its\nwarm light.  \n\nThis is a pulsing red stone, a tiny energy light, weighing approximately\n0 lbs.

It is rumored weapons like this were crafted through ritual\nsacrifice by a former dark order of mages known as The Adepts of the Blood\nPath, whose rites and history have since faded into obscurity.   \n\nThis is Necrosis, a medium water weapon, weighing approximately 2 lbs. \nThe weapon is a bandalore.  It is of near god-like workmanship and should\nfetch a little less than 350 silver in a respectable shop.

In the time when the\nfollowers of Zynor attempted to unleash him from his eternal slumber, it is\nsaid that Dabi used the Blade of Destruction to slay her father and consume\nhis being in a bath of blood.  In the ensuing slaughter Zynor was sliced\nopen, his blood spilled across the land, Dabi found herself a single wound\nthat released just a few drops of her blood.  An ancient lich from the\nfallen city was rumored to have sent minions across the land to collect the\nfew precious drops of both deities' blood.  It is said the power of the\nblood was enough to consume nearly half a legion of undead as they attempted\nto contain it's power and return it to its master.  It is never said how the\npower was contained, but it is said the blood was given unto the lich for\nhis purpose.  The second part of the legend is that the lich sent his\nminions out once more to collect a thousand mortals.  His minions brought\none thousand beings, each one bound and locked deep within the cursed city. \nThe lich then was said to use his ancient magic to sacrifice the scores of\nmortals and use their souls to form a vessel for the god's blood.  When the\nthousand souls had been forged, the blood was poured into the container and\nsealed for all eternity.  The necklace proved too powerful even for the\nancient lich, and he soon found his twisted mind broken under the power of\nthe god's blood.  The lich's minions saw their master's blight and stole the\nnecklace away one dark night.  The rumors say it was lost for years before\nit resurfaced.  \n\nThis is a circle of flowing blood, a medium energy treasure, weighing\napproximately 1 lbs.
