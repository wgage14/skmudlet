The ashes in the jar could be from any creature really, though the sheer amount seems to indicate that whatever burned cannot have been bigger than a halfling or gnome.  There are a number of ancient bedtime nursery tales which tell of evil magicians stealing naughty children from their parents, and using their ashes in various cruel experiments, but most are considered merely tools to attempt to inspire some manner of fear and good behaviour.  There are, however, also fairly credible reports of groups of necromancers using the body part of children in experiments, as it is believed their lack of conscientious understanding of the nature of necromancy allows the dark energy to flow easier through them.  One ritual tells of the ashes of a child being used to scry upon the area in which the magically treated eyes of same child is found.  The link between the two would be created through the flows of dark energy, maintained by the performance of a <255,255,255:0,0,0>ritual<192,192,192:0,0,0> wherein a perfect circle is drawn with the child's ash.

It is said that in the 930s, Pyrathia was showing signs of change.  The Age was old, and the Future was shrouded in a veil of uncertainty that even those gifted with the Sight had trouble gazing through.  The Weave was tangled, and great unrest lured beneath the calm surface.  The Blessed of Sadal were the first to take notice.  The Stormwatchers spoke of strange weather patterns, and rolls of dice which came up blank.  The Flock of Storms gathered, praying as one for a sign from Lady, so that they might be able to lead the nations of Pyrathia through as was ordained by their Lady's will.  They were answered, some with visions, some with Divine words.  A quest began, a journey meant to prove their strength of conviction and connection to the Lady.  They proved worthy.  Their journey ended with a simple game of chance, a coin thrown in the air by an old salt at the docks of Garazul.  The High follower won, and the wagered silver coin became the faith's new symbol, a silvery disc engraved with divine runes.  The disc is said to change according to the Path of its blessed, helping them steady their stride and remember the Pattern that they are a part of.  A prayer is said, and the chosen sphere of the Lady, <255,255,255:0,0,0>Fate<128,128,128:0,0,0>, <255,255,255:0,0,0>Luck<128,128,128:0,0,0> or <255,255,255:0,0,0>Storms<128,128,128:0,0,0> is invoked.

The gnomes berated the recalcitrant dwarf, calling into question his ability as a miner.  He spent years mining diamond ores and working up plans for an axe specially designed to inflict maximum pain on gnomes.  He went searching some distant tunnels when he finished his axe and got wind of the gnomes' whereabouts.  The tunnels were remote, and he got lost.  He ran across a wandering deep-elf and asked for directions, taking time to tell his tale of seeking vengeance. The deep-elf, intrigued by the story, told him the way, but crept back to his brethren and formed a party to ambush the dwarf and take the axe, for the deep-elves were plotting an assault on Craeftilin and wanted the weapon for themselves in their upcoming war against the gnomes. <192,192,192:0,0,0>This is Gn<128,0,0:0,0,0>o<192,192,192:0,0,0>mecr<128,0,0:0,0,0>u<192,192,192:0,0,0>sher, a small diamond weapon, weighing approximately 9 lbs.

Rumors about this necklace's origin fall to the birth of Dabi herself.  In the time when the followers of Zynor attempted to unleash him from his eternal slumber, it is said that Dabi used the Blade of Destruction to slay her father and consume his being in a bath of blood.  In the ensuing slaughter Zynor was sliced open, his blood spilled across the land, Dabi found herself a single wound that released just a few drops of her blood.  An ancient lich from the fallen city was rumored to have sent minions across the land to collect the few precious drops of both deities' blood.  It is said the power of the blood was enough to consume nearly half a legion of undead as they attempted to contain it's power and return it to its master.  It is never said how the power was contained, but it is said the blood was given unto the lich for his purpose.  The second part of the legend is that the lich sent his minions out once more to collect a thousand mortals.  His minions brought one thousand beings, each one bound and locked deep within the cursed city.  The lich then was said to use his ancient magic to sacrifice the scores of mortals and use their souls to form a vessel for the god's blood.  When the thousand souls had been forged, the blood was poured into the container and sealed for all eternity.  The necklace proved too powerful even for the ancient lich, and he soon found his twisted mind broken under the power of the god's blood.  The lich's minions saw their master's blight and stole the necklace away one dark night.
